Scalatron is a multi-player programming game in which bot programs written in [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/)
compete against each other. It is an educational resource for individuals or teams that want to learn more about the
Scala programming language or want to hone their Scala programming skills. - Follow [@scalatron](http://twitter.com/scalatron) on Twitter.


## If You Want To Play The Game...

...while learning Scala, install Scalatron and work through the step-by-step tutorial to create your first bot.
No prior knowledge of Scala is required and you do not need to install anything else (not even Scala).
