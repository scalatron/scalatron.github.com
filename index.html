        <p>This is the source code for Scalatron, a competitive multi-player programming game in which coders pit bot programs (written in Scala) against each other. It is an educational resource for groups of programmers or individuals that want to learn more about the Scala programming language or want to hone their Scala programming skills. </p>

<h2>How to Run</h2>

<p>If you want to run Scalatron to play the game or to run a workshop with friends, simply <a href="http://github.com/scalatron/scalatron/downloads">download the latest version</a> - you do not need the source code. Unzip the downloaded file into a local directory, then look for the Readme.txt file to get started. Have fun!</p>

<h2>How to Build</h2>

<p>If you want to get the source code and build Scalatron yourself, <a href="http://github.com/scalatron/scalatron/zipball/master">download the sources of the 'master' branch</a> and build them with <a href="http://github.com/harrah/xsbt">SBT</a>. Once you have SBT installed, switch to the directory where you downloaded the Scalatron sources (the directory that contains this the <code>build.sbt</code> file) and run</p>

<pre><code>sbt dist
</code></pre>

<p>This will generate a new directory called <code>dist</code> which contains the same content as the regular distribution. Now <code>cd</code> into /dist/bin and run <code>java -jar Scalatron.jar</code>. </p>
